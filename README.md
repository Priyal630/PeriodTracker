# PCOD Detection


Overview
This project focuses on developing an AI-powered system for detecting Polycystic Ovarian Disease (PCOD) using ultrasound images. By leveraging Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning techniques, we aim to provide an efficient and accurate diagnostic tool for early detection.

Features
✅ Automated PCOD detection from ultrasound images
✅ Deep learning models trained for high accuracy
✅ Data preprocessing and augmentation for better generalization
✅ Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
✅ Deployment-ready architecture

Dataset 
The dataset contains ultrasound images of ovaries, preprocessed and labeled for training and testing.
